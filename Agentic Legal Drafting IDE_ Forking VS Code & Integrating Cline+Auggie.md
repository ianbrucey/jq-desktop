**Agentic Legal Drafting IDE: Forking VS Code & Integrating Cline+Auggie** 

Building a **desktop agentic legal drafting IDE** starts with forking the open-source Code – OSS repository and customizing it. Code – OSS (MIT‑licensed) is the raw editor source, whereas Microsoft’s 1 2   
VS Code product is a branded distribution with proprietary additions . By cloning and building Code – OSS yourself, you get a “clean” VS Code build without Microsoft’s telemetry or licensing, under the MIT license . You can then *rebrand* this build by editing its product.json (changing   
3 1 

4 3   
names, logos, extension gallery endpoints, etc.) as Microsoft does when packaging VS Code . For example, Microsoft documents that replacing product.json yields a custom build: “When you build from 4   
the vscode repository, you can configure the resulting tool by customizing the product.json file” . A practical path is to follow VSCodium’s approach: use its build scripts to clone Code – OSS and produce 3   
installer binaries (Windows and macOS) with your own branding .  

•    
**Customize Branding & Build:** Clone microsoft/vscode, modify product.json and assets to set your IDE name, icons, and extension gallery (if any). Microsoft’s docs show how  4   
product.json controls “Gallery endpoints, telemetry endpoints, logos, names, and more” . Use the official build instructions or VSCodium’s CI scripts to compile Windows/macOS apps. 5 1   
Ensure you adhere to the MIT license of Code – OSS .  

•    
**License & Distribution:** Both VS Code and Cline are open-source (MIT/Apache), so redistributing 5 2   
your fork (including Cline extension code) is allowed . Use your own product name and avoid Microsoft trademarks. Because Code – OSS by default has no extension gallery configured   
6   
, you will typically bundle or pre-install any desired extensions (like Cline) into the app itself 

(see below).  

**Integrating Cline and Replacing Its Backend** 

Cline is an open-source AI assistant extension for VS   Code that embeds an agent in the IDE. Its architecture separates core AI logic from the UI and IDE bindings. Developers have outlined a modular layout with a **core** package (handling AI integrations, browsing, CLI, etc.), a shared React **UI**, and IDE 7   
specific adapters (e.g. VS Code entrypoint) . In this design, the core includes something like core/ 7   
src/ai for “Integrations with AI (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)” , meaning all LLM/API calls go through a common interface. The Cline README confirms it “supports API providers like OpenRouter, Anthropic, 8   
OpenAI, Google Gemini… and even local models through LM Studio/Ollama” . In practice, Cline runs 9   
entirely on your machine using *your* API keys – “your code never passes through our servers” – and makes HTTP calls to LLM endpoints via its core code.  

To use Auggie CLI instead of cloud APIs, you would locate where Cline invokes the LLM provider and swap in CLI calls. In the core’s AI integration code (e.g. core/src/ai/\* ), replace the HTTP fetch/SDK calls with a local process call to Auggie. You can spawn a child process from Node (e.g. via   
child\_process.spawn ) to run auggie commands and capture its output. Since Cline is model agnostic, it likely abstracts calls behind a provider interface (see how it even tracks tokens and costs per 10   
request ). By inserting Auggie’s CLI calls here, the user’s prompts and context go to the local agent instead of a remote API. In short, **modify Cline’s AI layer** to call Auggie: e.g. replace its OpenAI/ 

1  
Anthropic client code with something like await exec("auggie ...") . The rest of Cline’s UI (sidebar, diff views, chat) can remain intact.  

• 9 7   
**Cline’s Architecture:** Cline runs client-side with a core AI engine and React UI . Its core can create/edit files, run terminal commands, and fetch web content. Crucially, AI calls are 7   
centralized in the core modules (suggested by the core/src/ai/ folder structure ).  •    
**Swapping to Auggie CLI:** Modify the core AI code so it calls the local Auggie CLI (which requires internet for its model access) instead of remote APIs. For example, replace any code that calls OpenAI/Anthropic with a child\_process invocation of auggie . Because Cline already 8   
supports local models via LM Studio/Ollama , the pattern for calling a local binary is similar. This yields an entirely local agent path inside the IDE.  

**Bundling Cline as a Built-in Extension** 

11 12   
Since a VS Code fork can’t use Microsoft’s marketplace , you should ship the Cline extension with your custom IDE by default. There are two main approaches: (a) **Include it in the build** by copying the Cline extension folder into VS Code’s built-in extensions, or (b) **Use OpenVSX** as an alternative registry and have the IDE auto-install it. In either case, the extension API works the same in forks: “\[Cursor, 13   
Windsurf, Trae\] start with VS Code’s code-base, then layer on their own features” , and they allow adding VS   Code extensions normally. In practice, you can add Cline’s extension under resources/app/extensions/ in the product, or modify the build scripts to npm install the Cline extension folder.  

•    
**Pre-install Cline:** Add Cline’s extension files into the VS Code build so it’s “built-in”. This may 

involve adjusting the build (for example, by listing it in extensionPack or copying its VSIX). The Pieces IDE docs note that extensions for VS Code also work in forks because the underlying 13   
API is identical .  

•    
**Alternative Marketplace:** If you prefer updates, register Cline on an open registry like OpenVSX 11   
and point your fork’s product.json to it . Without Microsoft’s marketplace, OpenVSX is the usual solution (as VSCodium does). You could configure your product.json with an  extensionsGallery pointing to OpenVSX for Cline updates.  

**Custom Workflows for Legal Drafting** 

To support multi-file legal drafts and polished outputs, leverage VS Code’s markdown tools plus custom scripts: 

•    
**Multi-section Drafts:** Organize each section as a Markdown file in the workspace. VS Code’s 

built-in Markdown support lets you edit and preview these files (toggle preview with ⇧⌘V or 14 15   
split-view) . Use workspace link completions to cross-reference sections . You can also combine files: e.g. use Pandoc’s CLI to concatenate them into one HTML/PDF. Pandoc, a universal document converter, can merge multiple markdown inputs (in order) and output a 16 17   
single HTML or PDF . For example, running pandoc section1.md section2.md \-o  final.html will concatenate them. Pandoc even supports legal-style features like footnotes or citations. This handles assembling sections into one polished draft.  

•    
**Integrated Preview:** Use VS Code’s Markdown preview to see formatted output as you write. You can even inject custom CSS for legal formatting: VS Code allows adding your own stylesheet 18   
via the markdown.styles setting . For instance, include a CSS file that sets headers, fonts, numbering, etc., to mimic court or contract style. This way the live preview (and printing) reflects your legal styling.  

2  
•    
**Export/Print:** To produce final outputs, you have options. You can print from VS Code’s preview 

(though styling may differ) or use an extension or tool. For example, the “Markdown PDF” extension can export the markdown as PDF or HTML with one command. Alternatively, use Pandoc (via terminal or integrated task) to convert the combined markdown into a PDF/Word using your formatting. Pandoc can produce HTML or DOCX with a custom template and then 16   
PDF via LaTeX . In summary, your IDE could include a command or button that runs Pandoc (or Markdown PDF) on the project files to generate a print-ready document.  

**Prior Art: Existing VS Code Forks** 

Several projects demonstrate repackaging VS Code with AI features or branding. **VSCodium** is the 3   
canonical example: a community build of VS Code without Microsoft’s telemetry or branding . Its maintainer notes that building from the Code – OSS repo with a clean product.json yields a freely licensed MIT build . **Cursor** (from Sourcegraph) is a VS Code fork tailored for AI coding; it layers   
3 

natural-language code editing on top of VS Code’s UI (Cursor is closed-source but widely discussed). **Windsurf** (formerly Codeium Editor) similarly ships VS Code with built-in AI assistance. These IDEs prove the model: start from Code – OSS, add your agent framework (e.g. Cline), and customize the UI.  

Citing VSCodium: it “clones the vscode repo, lays down a customized product.json that has \[no MS 3   
customizations\], and produce(s) a build that we release under \[MIT\] license” . This process is exactly how to create your branded app. Note also that forks lose access to Microsoft’s extension ecosystem   
11 12   
 – for instance, Microsoft blocked VS Code forks from using Live Share or C++ tools. Instead, 11   
forks often use OpenVSX for extensions . In sum, these precedents show it is technically feasible: you can fork Code – OSS and include Cline as a default extension to make your own AI-powered editor. 

**Maintenance, Updates, and Long-term Support** 

Forking VS Code comes with ongoing responsibilities. Each new VS Code release introduces changes (UI updates, Electron upgrades, new APIs) that you must merge into your fork. As EclipseSource warns, a fork “often starts as a small change… but over time… changes to the fork accumulate. Maintaining 19   
compatibility with the rapidly evolving VS Code codebase becomes increasingly challenging” . In practice, teams have found that *even minor upstream changes* can cause “significant maintenance 20   
challenges” – what begins smoothly can “become a nightmare” as divergences grow . You will need a process to regularly sync from upstream Code – OSS, resolve conflicts, and rebuild your custom IDE.  

On the security front, you must manually apply any VS Code security patches or Electron/V8 updates. Automated testing (for example, using CI to rebuild and smoke-test on Windows/macOS) is important. Extension updates pose another task: if Cline or other bundled extensions release new versions, you’ll need to update them in your fork or allow them to update via OpenVSX.  

For distribution, build platform installers (DMG for Mac, MSI or EXE for Windows) for each release. Consider code-signing certificates for Mac and Windows to avoid “unverified developer” warnings. If your users require internet, provide update checks – perhaps host your own update server or use GitHub Releases. Finally, clearly communicate that this is a custom tool; its “lost marketplace” means 12 11   
users can’t install arbitrary VS Code Marketplace plugins without workarounds .  3  
**Summary Roadmap** 

In summary, the research suggests this development plan: 

1\.    
**Fork & Build Code – OSS:** Clone Microsoft’s VS Code repo, adjust product.json (names, 4 3   
icons, disable telemetry), and compile for Windows/macOS (e.g. using VSCodium scripts) . 5 2   
Ensure all licensing (MIT/Apache) is complied with . 

2\.    
**Integrate Cline Extension:** Add the Cline extension into the fork so it’s built-in (copy its folder or 8   
use OpenVSX). Verify Cline’s UI (sidebar, chat, diff view) appears correctly in your IDE . 3\.    
**Wire Auggie CLI:** Edit Cline’s core code (e.g. under core/src/ai ) to invoke the local Auggie CLI instead of remote LLM APIs. This means intercepting the prompt inputs and sending them to auggie (and passing back responses to Cline’s UI). Test with simple prompts to confirm Auggie runs as expected. 

4\.    
**Add Legal Workflows:** Implement commands or UI to manage multi-file drafts. For example, provide a “Combine Sections” command that runs a Pandoc pipeline on all .md files to generate 18   
HTML/PDF. Configure a default CSS (via markdown.styles ) for legal formatting . Enable highlighting/printing features (using Markdown preview’s print or a PDF-export extension). 

5\.    
**Package and Distribute:** Build installers for Mac and Windows. Include any dependencies (e.g. 

ensure Node/v8 for Auggie CLI) in the install. Provide update mechanism (auto-update or manual release). Document installation steps clearly for non-technical users.  

6\.    
**Ongoing Maintenance:** Establish a regular schedule to merge upstream VS Code changes and test your custom IDE. Monitor both VS Code and Cline/Auggie updates. Plan for security patches (e.g. Electron updates) and support channels (e.g. issue tracker). 

By following these steps and using the cited open-source foundations, you can create a self-hosted, AI powered drafting IDE. This fork will let users highlight text in any section, ask Auggie to rewrite or draft new content, manage many Markdown “section” files, and export a polished HTML/PDF – all without exposing data to external servers. The design leverages VS   Code’s filesystem APIs and Cline’s UI framework, swapped out for a local Auggie backend, resulting in a fully offline-capable drafting environment.
