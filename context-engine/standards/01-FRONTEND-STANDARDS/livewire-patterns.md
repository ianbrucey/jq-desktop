# Livewire Component Patterns

**Instructions:** Document your standards for building Livewire components. This should include:

- **Component Structure**: How to organize properties, methods, and lifecycle hooks.
- **Communication**: Preferred methods for parent-child and sibling component communication (`$dispatch`, attributes, etc.).
- **State Management**: Rules for managing loading states, modals, and other UI states.
- **Performance**: Best practices for optimization, such as using `#[lazy]` or `.defer`.
