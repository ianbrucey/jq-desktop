# Database Design Standards

**Instructions:** Define the standards for your database schema and interactions. This should cover:

- **Naming Conventions**: Rules for tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes.
- **Schema Design**: Principles for normalization, standard column types (e.g., `id`, `created_at`), and use of JSON columns.
- **Eloquent Usage**: Best practices for models, relationships, and query building.
- **Performance**: Guidelines for indexing, query optimization, and avoiding N+1 problems.
