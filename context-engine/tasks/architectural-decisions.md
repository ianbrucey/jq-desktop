# Architectural Decisions Log

## Overview

This document captures key architectural decisions made during the development of the Agentic Legal Drafting IDE, based on comprehensive research findings documented in `context-engine/intake/Gemini CLI VS Code Integration Guide.md`.

## Decision Log

### AD-001: Gemini CLI Integration Architecture

**Date**: 2025-01-04  
**Status**: Decided  
**Context**: Research revealed that Gemini CLI is a stateful agent with ReAct loops, not a simple command-line tool.

**Decision**: Implement stateful agent integration with persistent process management instead of transactional command execution.

**Rationale**:
- Gemini CLI maintains conversation state across interactions
- ReAct loops require parsing of reasoning phases, tool calls, and user confirmations
- Simple command execution model is insufficient for sophisticated AI interactions

**Consequences**:
- Requires complex state machine for CLI interaction parsing
- Need for persistent process management with proper lifecycle handling
- UI must support interactive confirmations and approval workflows

### AD-002: Authentication Strategy

**Date**: 2025-01-04  
**Status**: Decided  
**Context**: Multiple authentication methods available (OAuth, API key, ADC) with varying security implications.

**Decision**: Implement VS Code native AuthenticationProvider with OAuth 2.0 as primary method and fallback hierarchy.

**Rationale**:
- VS Code AuthenticationProvider provides consistent, secure UX
- OAuth 2.0 offers enterprise-grade security with proper token management
- Fallback hierarchy ensures compatibility with different deployment scenarios
- OS-native keychain integration via VS Code's SecretStorage API

**Consequences**:
- Requires browser-based OAuth flow implementation
- Need for secure credential storage and session management
- Must handle multiple authentication methods gracefully

### AD-003: Error Handling and Logging Architecture

**Date**: 2025-01-04  
**Status**: Decided  
**Context**: Production deployment requires comprehensive error handling and debugging capabilities.

**Decision**: Implement correlation ID system with structured logging and comprehensive HTTP error mapping.

**Rationale**:
- Multi-process architecture requires cross-process debugging capabilities
- Users need actionable error messages, not technical details
- Enterprise deployment requires audit trails and monitoring

**Consequences**:
- All operations must generate and propagate correlation IDs
- Need for centralized error service with user-friendly message mapping
- Requires structured logging framework with telemetry integration

### AD-004: CLI Output Processing Strategy

**Date**: 2025-01-04  
**Status**: Decided  
**Context**: Gemini CLI supports both interactive conversational output and structured JSON mode.

**Decision**: Support both modes with intelligent switching based on operation type and user preferences.

**Rationale**:
- Interactive mode provides rich conversational experience for complex tasks
- JSON mode enables reliable programmatic processing for simple operations
- Users should have control over interaction style based on context

**Consequences**:
- Need for dual output parsing systems
- UI must handle both conversational and structured output formats
- Configuration system must support mode selection and preferences

### AD-005: VS Code Extension Integration Pattern

**Date**: 2025-01-04  
**Status**: Decided  
**Context**: Cline extension can be integrated as external extension or built-in component.

**Decision**: Integrate Cline as built-in extension with modified publisher and build system integration.

**Rationale**:
- Built-in integration provides seamless user experience
- Eliminates dependency on external extension marketplace
- Allows for deeper customization and legal domain optimization

**Consequences**:
- Requires modification of VS Code build system
- Need for proper extension lifecycle management
- Must maintain compatibility with Cline's update cycle

### AD-006: Legal Domain Specialization Approach

**Date**: 2025-01-04  
**Status**: Decided  
**Context**: Legal professionals have specific requirements for document drafting, compliance, and audit trails.

**Decision**: Implement legal-specific features as configurable extensions to the core AI integration.

**Rationale**:
- Maintains general-purpose AI capabilities while adding legal specialization
- Allows for future expansion to other professional domains
- Provides compliance features required for legal industry

**Consequences**:
- Need for legal document template system
- Requires compliance audit trail generation
- Must implement confidentiality and security safeguards

## Implementation Impact

These architectural decisions fundamentally reshape the implementation approach:

1. **Complexity Increase**: From simple CLI wrapper to sophisticated stateful agent integration
2. **Security Requirements**: Enterprise-grade authentication and credential management
3. **User Experience**: Rich conversational interface with approval workflows
4. **Production Readiness**: Comprehensive error handling, logging, and monitoring
5. **Domain Specialization**: Legal-specific features and compliance requirements

## Next Steps

1. Update task implementation plans to reflect these architectural decisions
2. Create detailed technical specifications for each major component
3. Establish development milestones with clear success criteria
4. Set up testing framework to validate architectural assumptions
5. Begin implementation with authentication system as foundation
