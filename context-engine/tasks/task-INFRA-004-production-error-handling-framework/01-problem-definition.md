# Task INFRA-004: Production Error Handling Framework - Problem Definition

## 1. Problem Statement

While the current implementation includes basic error handling with correlation IDs and user-friendly messages, a production-ready Agentic Legal Drafting IDE requires a comprehensive, centralized error handling framework that provides enterprise-grade reliability, monitoring, and user experience.

## 2. Current State Analysis
