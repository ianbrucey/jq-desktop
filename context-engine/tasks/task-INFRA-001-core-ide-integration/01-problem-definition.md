# Task INFRA-001: Core IDE Integration - Problem Definition

## 1. Problem Statement

The core technical feasibility of building a desktop agentic legal drafting IDE relies on successfully forking VS Code, integrating the Cline extension, and replacing its cloud-based AI backend with a local Gemini CLI. Based on comprehensive research, this integration is significantly more complex than initially anticipated, requiring sophisticated authentication flows, stateful CLI interaction patterns, and advanced VS Code extension architecture.

**Key Technical Challenges Identified:**
- Gemini CLI operates as a stateful agent with ReAct (Reason and Act) loops, not a simple command-line tool
- OAuth 2.0 authentication flow requires browser-based consent and secure token management
- CLI output is streaming and conversational, requiring real-time parsing and state management
- Integration must handle multiple authentication methods (OAuth, API key, Vertex AI)
- Production deployment requires comprehensive error handling, logging, and update mechanisms

## 2. Target Users

This task primarily targets the **internal development team**. The output of this phase is a technical proof-of-concept that validates the architectural approach, not an end-user feature.

## 3. Success Metrics (Revised)

The successful completion of this task will be measured by the following **enhanced criteria**:

*   **Successful VS Code Fork with Cline Integration**: A working VS Code build with Cline extension properly integrated as a built-in extension.
*   **Comprehensive Cline Architecture Analysis**: Complete documentation of:
    *   ApiHandler interface and provider pattern implementation
    *   Authentication integration points with VS Code's native AuthenticationProvider API
    *   Streaming output handling and state management patterns
    *   Configuration and context management systems
*   **Production-Ready GeminiCLI Provider**: A robust `GeminiCliHandler` that implements:
    *   VS Code native authentication integration using AuthenticationProvider pattern
    *   Stateful CLI interaction with proper ReAct loop handling
    *   Streaming output processing with real-time UI updates
    *   Comprehensive error handling for all failure modes (network, auth, CLI errors)
    *   Secure credential storage using VS Code's SecretStorage API
*   **Authentication Flow Validation**: Working OAuth 2.0 flow that:
    *   Integrates with VS Code's native authentication UI
    *   Handles browser-based consent securely
    *   Supports multiple authentication methods (OAuth, API key, ADC)
    *   Provides clear user feedback and status indication
