# Task FEAT-002: Full GeminiProvider Implementation - Research

## 1. Research Summary

This task leverages the comprehensive research completed and documented in `context-engine/intake/Gemini CLI VS Code Integration Guide.md`. The research revealed fundamental architectural requirements that completely reshape the implementation approach from a simple CLI wrapper to a sophisticated stateful agent integration.

## 2. Key Research Findings

### 2.1 Gemini CLI Stateful Agent Architecture

*   **Critical Discovery**: Gemini CLI is not a simple command-line tool but a sophisticated stateful agent
*   **ReAct Loop Implementation**: CLI engages in Reason and Act cycles with internal monologue
*   **Conversational Interface**: Multi-turn interactions with context preservation across sessions
*   **Tool Integration**: Built-in support for file operations, web search, and code execution
*   **Interactive Confirmations**: User approval required for potentially destructive actions
*   **Command Structure**: Rich command set with slash commands (`/help`, `/clear`, `/exit`) and interactive modes

### 2.2 Authentication and Security Architecture

*   **OAuth 2.0 Flow**: Browser-based consent with local server redirect handling using `google-auth-library`
*   **VS Code Integration**: Native AuthenticationProvider pattern for consistent UX and secure credential storage
*   **Credential Hierarchy**: VS Code session → GEMINI_API_KEY → Google Cloud ADC → OAuth flow
*   **Secure Storage**: OS-native keychain integration via VS Code's SecretStorage API
*   **Enterprise Requirements**: Audit logging, command injection prevention, output sanitization

### 2.3 CLI Interface and Output Processing

*   **Interactive Mode**: Conversational interface with streaming output and user confirmations
*   **JSON Mode**: Structured output using `--json` flag for programmatic processing
*   **Streaming Capabilities**: Real-time output processing with incremental UI updates
*   **Error Handling**: Comprehensive HTTP error code mapping (400, 403, 429, 500, 503) with user-friendly responses
*   **State Management**: Persistent conversation state with proper cleanup mechanisms
*   **Context Files**: Support for GEMINI.md files with project-specific instructions

### 2.4 VS Code Extension Integration Patterns

*   **ApiHandler Interface**: Standardized provider pattern with `createMessage()` method and streaming output support
*   **Configuration Management**: Hierarchical settings with project-level overrides via settings.json
*   **Context Integration**: File content, workspace structure, and user selection handling via Cline's context system
*   **UI Integration**: StatusBarItem for authentication status, progress indicators, and error notifications
*   **Error Propagation**: Structured error handling with correlation IDs for cross-process debugging

### 2.5 Production Deployment Considerations

*   **CLI Dependency Management**: Version checking on extension activation, installation guidance, automated updates
*   **Logging and Telemetry**: Correlation IDs across process boundaries for debugging multi-process architecture
*   **Performance Optimization**: Efficient process management with proper resource cleanup and memory management
*   **Security Posture**: Sandboxing options (`--sandbox`), output validation, audit trail generation
*   **Update Mechanisms**: Automated CLI updates via integrated terminal with user notification

### 2.6 Legal Domain Specific Requirements

*   **Context File Integration**: GEMINI.md files for legal-specific context and instructions
*   **Document Template Support**: Integration with legal document templates and precedent databases
*   **Compliance Features**: Audit trails, version control integration, confidentiality safeguards
*   **Specialized Prompting**: Legal-specific system prompts and reasoning patterns for document drafting
