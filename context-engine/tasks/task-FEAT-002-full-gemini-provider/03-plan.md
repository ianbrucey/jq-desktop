# Task FEAT-002: Full GeminiProvider Implementation - Plan

## 1. High-Level Plan (Completely Revised)

Based on comprehensive research findings, this task transforms the basic `GeminiCliHandler` PoC into a production-ready stateful agent integration. The plan addresses the fundamental architectural shift from simple command execution to sophisticated conversational AI interaction with enterprise-grade security and reliability.

**Key Architectural Pillars:**
1. **Stateful Agent Integration**: ReAct loop processing with conversational state management
2. **Enterprise Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with VS Code native integration and secure credential storage
3. **Production Architecture**: Comprehensive error handling, logging, and monitoring
4. **Legal Domain Optimization**: Specialized prompting and compliance features

## 2. Detailed Steps (Completely Revised)

### Step 2.1: Implement Production Authentication System

*   **Action**: Create `GeminiAuthenticationProvider` implementing VS Code's `AuthenticationProvider` interface

    *   Integrate with VS Code's SecretStorage API for secure credential persistence
*   **Action**: Implement multi-method authentication support
    *   Credential resolution hierarchy: VS Code session → GEMINI_API_KEY → Google Cloud ADC → OAuth
    *   Add authentication status monitoring with StatusBarItem integration
    *   Create user-friendly authentication prompts and error handling
*   **Action**: Add enterprise security features
    *   Implement audit logging for authentication events

    *   Map HTTP error codes (400, 403, 429, 500, 503) to user-friendly messages
    *   Implement correlation IDs for cross-process debugging
    *   Add structured logging with telemetry integration
*   **Action**: Implement retry logic and recovery strategies
    *   Exponential backoff for transient failures
    *   Circuit breaker pattern for persistent failures
    *   Graceful degradation with fallback mechanisms
*   **Action**: Add monitoring and diagnostics
    *   CLI health checking and dependency validation
    *   Performance metrics collection and reporting
    *   User-facing status indicators and progress reporting

### Step 2.4: Implement Advanced Configuration and Context Management

*   **Action**: Create hierarchical configuration system
    *   Support for system, user, and project-level settings.json files
    *   GEMINI.md context file discovery and parsing for legal-specific instructions
    *   Dynamic configuration updates with hot-reloading support
*   **Action**: Implement CLI dependency management
    *   Version checking on extension activation with user guidance
    *   Automated update flow via integrated terminal
    *   Dependency validation with clear error messaging
*   **Action**: Add legal domain specialization
    *   Legal document template integration
    *   Precedent database connectivity
    *   Compliance audit trail generation

### Step 2.5: Build Comprehensive Testing and Validation Framework

*   **Action**: Create unit testing suite
    *   Mock CLI interactions for isolated testing
    *   Authentication flow testing with mock OAuth providers
    *   Error handling scenario validation
*   **Action**: Implement integration testing
    *   End-to-end authentication flow testing
    *   Stateful CLI interaction testing with real Gemini CLI
    *   Performance and stress testing under load
*   **Action**: Add production validation
    *   Security audit and penetration testing
    *   Compliance validation for legal industry requirements
    *   User acceptance testing with legal professionals

### Step 2.6: Production Deployment and Documentation

*   **Action**: Prepare deployment artifacts
    *   Create installation packages for Windows, macOS, and Linux
    *   Set up code signing for trusted distribution
    *   Implement automated update distribution mechanism
*   **Action**: Create comprehensive documentation
    *   User setup guide with Google Cloud project configuration
    *   Administrator deployment guide for enterprise environments
    *   Troubleshooting guide with common issues and solutions
*   **Action**: Establish monitoring and support infrastructure
