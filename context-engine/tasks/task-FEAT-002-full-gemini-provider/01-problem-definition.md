# Task FEAT-002: Full GeminiProvider Implementation - Problem Definition

## 1. Problem Statement

Based on comprehensive research findings, the current `GeminiCliHandler` PoC requires a complete architectural overhaul to support the Gemini CLI's sophisticated stateful agent capabilities. The research revealed that Gemini CLI operates as a conversational agent with ReAct (Reason and Act) loops, requiring fundamentally different interaction patterns than simple command execution.

**Critical Requirements Identified:**
- **Stateful Agent Interaction**: Gemini CLI maintains conversation state and engages in multi-turn reasoning
- **ReAct Loop Processing**: CLI output includes reasoning phases, tool calls, and user confirmation requests
- **Authentication Integration**: Full OAuth 2.0 flow with VS Code native authentication patterns
- **Production-Grade Architecture**: Comprehensive error handling, logging, and security measures

The current PoC's simple command execution model is insufficient for real-world agentic operations. A production-ready implementation must handle the CLI's conversational nature, sophisticated output parsing, and enterprise-grade security requirements.

## 2. Target Users

This task targets both **internal development team** and **end-users** of the Agentic Legal Drafting IDE:

**Internal Development Team:**
- Robust, maintainable codebase with comprehensive testing
- Clear architectural patterns for future enhancements
- Production-ready deployment and monitoring capabilities

**End-Users (Legal Professionals):**
- Seamless authentication experience with enterprise security
- Reliable AI assistance with clear status indication
- Professional error handling with actionable guidance

## 3. Success Metrics (Completely Revised)

The successful completion of this task will be measured by the following **enhanced criteria**:

### 3.1 Authentication and Security
*   **Production OAuth 2.0 Flow**: Complete integration with VS Code's AuthenticationProvider API
*   **Multi-Method Authentication**: Support for OAuth, API key (GEMINI_API_KEY), and Google Cloud ADC
*   **Secure Credential Management**: Integration with VS Code's SecretStorage and OS-native keychains
*   **Enterprise Security Compliance**: Command injection prevention, output sanitization, audit logging

### 3.2 Stateful Agent Interaction
*   **ReAct Loop Processing**: Real-time parsing of reasoning phases, tool calls, and confirmation requests
*   **Conversational State Management**: Proper handling of multi-turn interactions and context preservation
*   **Interactive Mode Support**: User approval workflows for CLI actions and tool executions
*   **Streaming Output Processing**: Real-time UI updates with structured output parsing

### 3.3 Production-Grade Architecture
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling**: HTTP error code mapping (400, 403, 429, 500, 503) with user-friendly messages
*   **Correlation ID System**: Cross-process debugging with structured logging and telemetry
*   **CLI Lifecycle Management**: Version checking, dependency validation, automated updates
*   **Performance Optimization**: Efficient process management with proper resource cleanup

### 3.4 Legal Domain Integration
*   **Context-Aware Processing**: Integration with legal document templates and precedent databases
*   **Specialized Prompt Engineering**: Legal-specific system prompts and reasoning patterns
*   **Compliance Features**: Audit trails, version control integration, confidentiality safeguards
