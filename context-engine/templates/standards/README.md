# Project Standards

Place your coding and architecture standards in this folder. Agents will check these files when making coding decisions.

## Suggested Structure

- `backend-standards.md` - Backend coding standards (PHP, Laravel, database)
- `frontend-standards.md` - Frontend standards (JavaScript, CSS, frameworks)
- `api-standards.md` - API design and documentation standards
- `testing-standards.md` - Testing requirements and patterns
- `security-standards.md` - Security best practices

## Usage

Add your project-specific standards to these files. Agents will automatically reference them when:
- Writing new code
- Refactoring existing code
- Making architectural decisions
- Reviewing code quality

Keep standards clear, specific, and up-to-date.
